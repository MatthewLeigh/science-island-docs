You could use a virtual machine (VM), which emulates an entire operating system, but VMs are bulky, slow to start, and consume a lot of resources. This is where Docker comes in. Instead of virtualizing an entire OS, Docker containers share the host system\u2019s kernel while keeping applications and their dependencies isolated. This makes containers lightweight, fast to start, and highly portable, ensuring your application runs the same way everywhere \u2014 without the overhead of traditional VMs.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"docker/upload-image-to-docker-hub":{"id":"docker/upload-image-to-docker-hub","title":"Upload Image to Docker Hub","description":"Pushing your image to Docker Hub means that it can be downloaded by anyone very easily.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"documentation-management/create-docs":{"id":"documentation-management/create-docs","title":"Create Docs","description":"","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"documentation-management/docusarus-overview":{"id":"documentation-management/docusarus-overview","title":"Docusaurus Overview","description":"","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"documentation-management/edit-docs":{"id":"documentation-management/edit-docs","title":"Edit Docs","description":"","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"documentation-management/updating-for-new-project-team":{"id":"documentation-management/updating-for-new-project-team","title":"Updating for New Project Team","description":"","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"kubernetes/what-the-helm":{"id":"kubernetes/what-the-helm","title":"What the Helm?","description":"","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"overview":{"id":"overview","title":"Overview","description":"Since its inception in 2014, Science Island has grown into a complex and expansive system, shaped by the contributions of over 1,000 developers.
