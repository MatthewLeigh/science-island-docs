Great! But what happens when you need to run it on another machine \u2014 maybe a server, a teammate\u2019s laptop, or a cloud environment? You could use a virtual machine (VM), which emulates an entire operating system, but VMs are bulky, slow to start, and consume a lot of resources. This is where Docker comes in. Instead of virtualizing an entire OS, Docker containers share the host system\u2019s kernel while keeping applications and their dependencies isolated. This makes containers lightweight, fast to start, and highly portable, ensuring your application runs the same way everywhere \u2014 without the overhead of traditional VMs.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"overview":{"id":"overview","title":"Overview","description":"Since its inception in 2014, Science Island has grown into a complex and expansive system, shaped by the contributions of over 1,000 developers. Over the years, multiple teams have worked on different aspects of the project, resulting in a rich tapestry of innovation, problem-solving, and technical evolution. The project has withstood shifting industry trends, varying development approaches, and the challenges inherent in long-term, large-scale software maintenance.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"}}}}')}}]);
