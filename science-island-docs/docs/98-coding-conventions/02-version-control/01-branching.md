# Branching

All branching within the project must adhere to the following requirements:

- Use Kebab Case for branch names (e.g., add-authentication).
- Only use alphanumeric characters in branch names.
- Branch names should either be the same as the task name, or clearly indicate the task being worked on.
- Depending on how tasks end up being divvied up, we may prepend one of the following titles with a forward slash (/) to the branch name to further specify its purpose:
- **[Top level task name/title]:** If sub tasks are being given to different team members
  - **feature:** For new functionality
  - **bugfix:** For fixing issues
  - **refactor:** For code improvements
  - **docs:** For documentation updates
  - **test:** For test related changes
